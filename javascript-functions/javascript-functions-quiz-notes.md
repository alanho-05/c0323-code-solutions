## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is a function in JavaScript?
  - Javascript function is a user defined block of code that can be ran multiple times and return a value.

- Describe the parts of a function **definition**.
  - Function is defined by using the function keyword followed by a optional function name with a comma-separated list of zero or more parameters within parentheses. Then we have our block of code within curly braces. Return statement at the end if needed.

- Describe the parts of a function **call**.
  Function is called by writing the function name with zero or more arguments surrounded by parentheses.

- When comparing them side-by-side, what are the differences between a function **call** and a function **definition**?
  Function call does not have the 'function' keyword or the code block that is being ran. A value is returned when calling a function.

- What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**?
  - Parameter is a placeholder when a function is being defined, it's value is not known yet. Argument are values being passed in place of parameters when the function is being called.

- Why are function **parameters** useful?
  - Function parameters are useful because functions can have different results based on the parameters passed into the function.

- What two effects does a `return` statement have on the behavior of a function?
  - Return causes function to produce value we can use and stops the function's code block from continuing.
