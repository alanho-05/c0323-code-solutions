## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is the purpose of a loop?
Loops are used to run a code block multiple times until the expression of the conditions becomes false.

- What is the purpose of a **condition** expression in a loop?
The condition expression in a loop is to tell the loop when to stop running.

- What does "iteration" mean in the context of loops?
Iteration is the process in which the code block is executed once.

- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `while` loop get evaluated?
Condition is evaluated before each pass through the loop.

- _When_ does the **initialization** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
The initialization expression of a for loop is evaluated before loop begins.

- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
The condition of a for loop is evaluated before code block is executed.

- _When_ does the **final** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
The final expression of a for loop is evaluated after the code block has been executed and before the next conditional evaluation.

- Besides a `return` statement, which exits its entire function block, which keyword exits a loop before its **condition** expression evaluates to `false`?
The break keyword will exit a loop without exiting the function block.

- What does the `++` increment operator do?
The ++ increment operator increases the number by 1.

- How do you iterate through the keys of an object?
You can iterate through the keys of an object with for in loop.
