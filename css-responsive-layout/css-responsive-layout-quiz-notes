## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is a **breakpoint** in responsive Web design?
Breakpoint is the size at which point contents start to break in some way.
So content is resized to accommodate for different screens.

- What is the advantage of using a percentage (_e.g._ `50%`) `width` instead of a fixed (_e.g._ `px`) `width` for a "column" class in a responsive layout?
Advantage of percentage width is that they resize based on the viewport width that is available for the content instead of being a fixed and going outside of the available viewport width.

- If you introduce CSS rules for a smaller `min-width` _after_ the styles for a larger `min-width` in your style sheet, the CSS rules for the **smaller** `min-width` will "win". Why is that?
The Smaller min-width wins because it is declared later in the CSS rule sets, overriding the larger min-width before. So it will only look at the smaller min-width.
