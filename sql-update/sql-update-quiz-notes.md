## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- How do you update rows in a database table?
  With the `update` and `set` clauses, rows in a database table can be updated.

- Why is it important to include a `where` clause in your `update` statements?
  Without the `where` clause the `update` statement updates all value in a table.
  So where clause helps target only specific rows.
