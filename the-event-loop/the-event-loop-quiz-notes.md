## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is the JavaScript Event Loop?
  JavaScript Event Loop is the runtime model for JS. It is responsible for executing the code, collecting and processing events, and executing queued sub-tasks.

- What is different between "blocking" and "non-blocking" with respect to how code is executed?
  Blocking refers to operations that stops further code execution until that operation finishes. Executes synchronously.
  Non-blocking refers to code that doesnt block executions. Executes asynchronously.

For Node.js, blocking is when the execution of additional JavaScript in Node.js process must wait until a non-JavaScript operation completes.
