## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What are the `async` and `await` keywords used for?
  `async` and `await` keywords are used to enable an asynchronous, promise-based behavior. Making asynchronous functions look more like synchronous code.

- How do `async` and `await` differ from `Promise.then` and `Promise.catch`?
  async and await looks more synchronous, does not have any states as it returns a promise either resolved or reject and is easier to read/follow.

- When do you use `async`?
  `async` is used to declare an asynchronous function.

- When do you use `await`? When do you _not_ use `await`? (What happens if you `await` a synchronous function?)
  `await` is used to wait for a Promise and get is filfillment value and can only be used within a `async`. Do not want to use an `await` when you want your function to run synchronously. If used it will change it to an asynchronous function.

- How do you handle errors with `await`?
  We use .catch() method to handle errors with `await`.

- What do `try`, `catch` and `throw` do? When do you use them?
  `try`: will run the code block when its function is called. Used when want a code block to run.
  `catch`: is the block that runs when `try` throws an exception. Used when try block has an error and throws an exception.
  `throw`: used to throw an exception and specify the value to be thrown. Used to throw a user-defined exception.

- What happens if you forget to use `await` on a Promise? In that case, what happens to the Promise rejection?
  The code would not wait at the promise object and continue tracing the code. Without the await, the promise object is returned.

- Which style of asynchronous programming do you prefer â€” callbacks, `Promise.then`, or `async/await`? Why?
  Currently I prefer `Promise.then` since I can currently understand it better than `async/await`.
