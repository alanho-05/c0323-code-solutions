## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is the `event.target`?
The event.target is that element that is being interacted with and triggering an event.

- What is the affect of setting an element to `display: none`?
The affect of setting an element to display: none is that it turns off the display of an element so it has no effect on the HTML layout.

- What does the `element.matches()` method take as an argument and what does it return?
The element.matches() method takes a string CSS selector and returns a boolean value.

- How can you retrieve the value of an element's attribute?
With getAttribute() method, you can retrieve the value of an element's attribute.

- At what steps of the solution would it be helpful to log things to the console?
At each step of the solution it would be helpful to log things to the console. Especially when you are defining something new.

- If you were to add another tab and view to your HTML, but you didn't use event delegation, how would your JavaScript code be written instead?
We would need to addEventListener to all of the individual tabs as well to any newly added tabs.

- If you didn't use a loop to conditionally show or hide the views in the page, how would your JavaScript code be written instead?
Switch case or if else statement for each statement.
<!-- Would have to individually check each page to see if it needs to be hidden or not. So the same code will be written out for each tabs we have. -->
